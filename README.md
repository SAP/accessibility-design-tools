# Accessibility Design Tools Figma Plugins

## About this project

The Accessibility Design Tools Figma plugins offer a subset of annotations of the Accessibility Design Tools Figma library for Designers.
They are intended to annotate accessibility-relevant information in application and control visual and interaction design before handover to development.

[Documentation of the Accessibility Design Tools Figma library](https://experience.sap.com//wp-content/uploads/files/guidelines/Uploads/Accessibility/AccessibilityDesignToolsDocumentation.pdf) is located in experience.sap.com.

## Requirements and Setup

The plugin sources are located in the ACCAssets subfolder of this repository. They have to be installed in a typical project structure for Figma Plugin development with an IDE like VS Code. Please note that the required Figma node _modules subdirectory to run the plugins is NOT part of this distribution and should be created as part of the code setup according to Figma plugin development documentation.

For more details, please contact the respective [Figma plugin development documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/).
